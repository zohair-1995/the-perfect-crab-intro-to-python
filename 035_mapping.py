# Mapping is going through a list and converting ('mapping') each item to
# another item. This is useful when you want to perform the same operation
# across a list of items.

# For example:

# * Getting the price of each in a list of products
# * Making each in a list of words uppercase
# * Finding the first letter of each in a list of words

# Here's an example:

words = ['I', 'need', 'another', 'five', 'years']

first_letters = [] # This is our accumulator again

for word in words: # We go through each word
  first_letter = word[0] # Get the first letter
  # And append it to our accumulator list:
  first_letters.append(first_letter)

print(words)
print(first_letters)

# @TASK: run this program to see what it does.

# @TASK: Complete this exercise.

def add_one_hundred_to_numbers(numbers):

  first_hundreds = []  #this is out accumulator
  for number in numbers:  #we go through each number in the list
    first_hundred = number + 100  #get the first number and the list and add one hundred
    first_hundreds.append(first_hundred)   #and append the above to the accummulator
  return first_hundreds
