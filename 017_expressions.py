# Now, let's look at expressions. You've actually already seen them a lot!

added = 2 + 3

# Is this an expression? Not quite. It does contain an expression though.

# The expression part is this:

2 + 3

# The expression is the fundamental unit of computation in your program. It is
# the combination of data and operators (and some other things) to produce a
# result.

# Here are some more examples of expressions:

2            # Evaluates to: 2
2 + 3        # Evaluates to: 5
2 * 3        # Evaluates to: 6
2 + 3 * 4    # Evaluates to: ...???

# Well, what is that last one?
#
# Do we take 2 + 3 making 5, then multiply by 4 to get 20?
#
# Or do we multiply 3 * 4 to get 12, then add 2 to get 14?
#
# @TASK: You can find out by running `python` in your terminal and typing that code
# into it. You'll see something like this:
#
# ```
# Python 3.10.9 (main, Dec 15 2022, 10:44:50) [Clang 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.202)] on darwin
# Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
# >>> 2 + 3 * 4
# 14
# >>>
# ```
#
# You can then type in 'exit()' to leave Python.
#
# So we get 14! Python executes the multiplication first, and then the addition.
# We can control this using brackets.
#
# @TASK: Try this using `python` in the terminal:

(2 + 3) * 4

# As you can see, we can use brackets to control the order the expressions are
# evaluated.

# That handy "`python` in the terminal" thing is called the Python REPL. REPL
# stands for Read, Evaluate, and Print Loop. It reads the code you type in,
# evaluates the expression, prints the result, and then does that forever in a
# loop.
#
# You can use it to find out what different expressions evaluate to, and
# generally play around with Python to see what it does.

# I'm going to reintroduce the `add_one` function:

def add_one(num):
  return num + 1

# Here are some more expressions:

add_one(2)          # Evaluates to 3
add_one(3)          # Evaluates to 4
add_one(4) * 3      # Evaluates to 15
2 + add_one(4) * 3  # Evaluates to 17

# What to take from this? Calling a function is also an expression! Many things
# in Python are expressions, and we can combine data, operators, and function
# calls into some very advanced expressions.

# @TASK: Try those expressions yourself. Run:
#
#   python -i 017_expressions.py
#
# And then type in some of the above expressions.
#
# The `-i` flag means 'open a REPL that can use the code in this file'

# To finish off, here's a real mind-bender:

add_one(add_one(add_one(add_one(add_one(add_one(1))))))

# @TASK: What do you think that evaluates to? And why? Give it a go and find
# out.

# @TASK: Play around with building complex expressions in the space below.

# EXPRESSIONS PLAYGROUND BEGINS
def complex_expression(num_two):
  return (add_one(add_one(add_one(add_one(add_one(add_one(num_two)*3))))))/2*5+add_one(num_two)


# EXPRESSIONS PLAYGROUND ENDS

# When you're done, move on to 018_statements.py
